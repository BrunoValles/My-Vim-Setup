# My-Vim/NeoVim-Setup
My vim Setup for work and productivity.

This are the settings I use for vim on my personal machine. It includes some plugins I find very usefull and some features I really like (Like atuo-close parentheses)

For this you will need a plugin manager, the one I use is [this one][1]


You can find our more on my setup guide (to be added)
